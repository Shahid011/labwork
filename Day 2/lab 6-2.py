You live 4 miles from university. The bus drives at 25mph but spends 2 minutes at each
of the 10 stops on the way. How long will the bus journey take? Alternatively, you could
run to university. You jog the first mile at 7mph; then run the next two at15mph; before
jogging the last at 7mph again. Will this be quicker or slower than the bus?
